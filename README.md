### How would you implement that awesome popup design idea?

Some ideas:

- You can keep it simple.
- You don't need to implement it exactly as the shiny gif demonstrates you to look like - Be creative or just solve the task.
- You don't need to use any framework or library at all - If you like to use any, please feel free to do so.
